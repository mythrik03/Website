## About Holo Taco

You can visit the [Holo Taco website](https://www.holotaco.com/) for more information and to purchase the nail polish.

Holo Taco was created by Simply Nailogical(YouTuber). It was published on July 2019. Holo stands for holographic and taco is a reference to a running joke on her channel where top coats are referred to as "tacos".

### Collections

Since its creation, there have been 12 collections of nail polish(and counting!). These are the collection names: Tea Cremes, Sweet Cremes, Tropic Like Its Hot, Unicorns Just Wanna Have Sun, Electric Holos, For Art's Sake, Pastel Rainbow, Unicorn Dream, The Rainbow, Unicorn Bundle, Frosted Metals, and Multichrome. 


### My Favorite 

My personal favorite released Holo Taco nail polish is "Purple with Envy" from the Multichrome collection. Comparatively to the holos, it is easy to remove and still provides an entrancing factor. The colors shift from "royal purple and transforms through shades of indigo, blue and magenta, reaching as far as gold." It pairs well with a scattered holo topper or a unicorn flakie. I prefer to wear it with a glossy top coat because a matte top coat removes most of the shifting.
